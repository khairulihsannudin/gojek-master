Well this is my first time creating a Landing Page, especially from Gojek.
I learnt many things about the usage of useState, useEffect, and useRef hooks.
I also learnt a lot about how to make Carousel using Swiper JS and customizing it as I need
It still has many bugs, I guess, and the page is not responsive yet. I am going to fix it after I finish my final exam first.
